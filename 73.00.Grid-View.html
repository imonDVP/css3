What is a Grid-View?
Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into columns.
Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes it easier to place elements on the page.
A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window. -->
<!--
Building a Responsive Grid-View
Lets start building a responsive grid-view.
First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements.
Add the following code in your CSS:
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
} -->
<!-- However, we want to use a responsive grid-view with 12 columns, to have more control over the web page.
First we must calculate the percentage for one column: 100% / 12 columns = 8.33%.
Then we make one class for each of the 12 columns, class="col-" and a number defining how many columns the section should span -->
<!-- Notice that the webpage in the example does not look good when you resize the browser window to a very small width. In the next chapter you will learn how to fix that. -->
