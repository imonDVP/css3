        By default, the background color of the document is "tan". If the screen size is 992px or less, the color will
        change to "blue". If it is 600px or less, it will change to "olive".

<!--
Media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to different devices. To demonstrate a
simple example, we can change the background color for different devices. -->
<!-- 
Do you wonder why we use exactly 992px and 600px? They are what we call "typical breakpoints" for devices. You can read more about typical breakpoints in our Responsive Web Design Tutorial. -->
