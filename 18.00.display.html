<!-- The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.
The <script> element uses display: none; as default. -->
<!-- As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.
Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards. -->
<!-- Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it. -->
<!-- Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there. -->
<!-- visibility:hidden; also hides an element.
However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout -->
<!-- Difference between display:none and visiblity: hidden
visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space. -->
<!-- display	Specifies how an element should be displayed
visibility	Specifies whether or not an element should be visible -->
