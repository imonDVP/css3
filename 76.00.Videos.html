    <title>Using The width Property</title>
    <!-- If the width property is set to 100%, the video player will be responsive and scale up and down: -->
    <style>
        video {
            width: 100%;
            height: auto;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <video width="400" controls>
        <source src="duck.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="duck.mp4" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
    </video>
    <p>Resize the browser window to see how the size of the video player will scale.</p>
</body>
</html>


Notice that in the example above, the video player can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better
solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.
