<!--
Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. -->
<!-- Grid Elements
A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements. -->
<!--
Display Property
An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid or inline-grid. -->
<!-- All direct children of the grid container automatically become grid items. -->
<!-- The vertical lines of grid items are called columns.
The horizontal lines of grid items are called rows.-->
<!-- Grid Gaps
The spaces between each column/row are called gaps. -->
<!-- You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:
1.column-gap
2.row-gap
3.gap -->
<!-- The column-gap property sets the gap between the columns.
The row-gap property sets the gap between the rows.
The gap property is a shorthand property for the row-gap and the column-gap properties.
The gap property can also be used to set both the row gap and the column gap in one value-->
<!-- Grid Lines
The lines between columns are called column lines.
The lines between rows are called row lines. -->
