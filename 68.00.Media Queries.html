<!-- CSS2 Introduced Media Types:
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.
CSS3 Introduced Media Queries:
Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
1.width and height of the viewport
2.width and height of the device
3.orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
4.resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones). -->
<!--
Media Query Syntax:
A media query consists of a media type and can contain one or more expressions, which resolve to either true or false.
Syntax:
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
  CSS-Code;
}
The result of the query is true if the specified media type matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.
Unless you use the not or only operators, the media type is optional and the all type will be implied.
You can also have different stylesheets for different media:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="mediatype and|not|only (expressions)" href="print.css"> -->
<!--
CSS3 Media Types
Value	Description
all	Used for all media type devices
print	Used for printers
screen	Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.
speech	Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud -->
<!-- Change the background color of the <body> element to "lightblue" when the browser window is 600px wide or less:
    @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
    } -->
<!--
meaning of the not, only and and keywords:
1.not: The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query.
2.only: The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.
3.and: The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features.
They are all optional. However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a media type. -->

<!-- Change the background color of the <body> element to "lightblue" when the browser window is 600px wide or less:
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
} -->
<!--
Hide an element when the browser's width is 600px wide or less:
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  div.example {
    display: none;
  }
} -->
<!--
Use mediaqueries to set the background-color to lavender if the viewport is 800 pixels wide or wider, to lightgreen if the viewport is between 400 and 799 pixels wide. If the viewport is smaller than 400 pixels, the background-color is lightblue:
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  body {
    background-color: lavender;
  }
} -->
<!--
Create a responsive navigation menu (displayed horizontally on large screens and vertically on small screens):
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .topnav a {
    float: none;
    width: 100%;
  }
} -->
<!--
Use media queries to create a responsive column layout:
/* On screens that are 992px wide or less, go from four columns to two columns */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  .column {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
/* On screens that are 600px wide or less, make the columns stack on top of each other instead of next to each other */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .column {
    width: 100%;
  }
} -->
<!--
Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser. You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called "Landscape" orientation.
Use a lightblue background color if the orientation is in landscape mode:
@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
} -->
<!--
Use mediaqueries to set the text color to green when the document is displayed on the screen, and to black when it is printed:
@media screen {
  body {
    color: green;
  }
}
@media print {
  body {
    color: black;
  }
} -->
<!--
Comma separated list: add an additional media query to an already existing one, using a comma (this will behave like an OR operator):
/* When the width is between 600px and 900px OR above 1100px - change the appearance of <div> */
@media screen and (max-width: 900px) and (min-width: 600px), (min-width: 1100px) {
  div.example {
    font-size: 50px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 8px solid black;
    background: yellow;
  }
} -->
