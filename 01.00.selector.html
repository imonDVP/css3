<!-- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets -->
<!-- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media -->
<!-- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once -->
<!-- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files -->
<!-- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. -->
<!-- A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. -->
<!-- The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. -->
<!-- The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. -->
<!-- Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. -->
<!-- Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. -->

<!-- A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style. -->
<!-- CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style. -->
<!-- We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
1.Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
2.ombinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
3.Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
4.Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
5.Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) -->
<!-- The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. -->
<!-- The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. -->
<!-- The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. -->
<!-- The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma. -->
