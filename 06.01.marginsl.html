        In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 element has a top margin of 20px. So, the
        vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 70px (50px + 20px). However, due to margin collapse, the
        actual margin ends up being 50px.

    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

<!-- In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px.
Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px. -->
<!-- Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin. -->
<!-- Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.
This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins! -->
<!-- margin	A shorthand property for setting all the margin properties in one declaration
margin-bottom	Sets the bottom margin of an element
margin-left	Sets the left margin of an element
margin-right	Sets the right margin of an element
margin-top	Sets the top margin of an element -->
