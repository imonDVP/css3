What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. -->
<!-- Add a Breakpoint:
Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.
Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint. -->
<!-- Always Design for Mobile First:
Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices).
This means that we must make some changes in our CSS.
Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px. This will make our design Mobile First. -->
<!-- Another Breakpoint
You can add as many breakpoints as you like.
We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones. -->
<!--
Typical Device Breakpoints:
There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:
1.Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down)
2.Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up)
3.Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up)
4.Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up)
5.Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up)  -->
<!-- Orientation: Portrait / Landscape
Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser.
You can have a set of CSS properties that will only apply when the browser window is wider than its height, a so called "Landscape" orientation -->
<!-- Hide Elements With Media Queries
Another common use of media queries, is to hide elements on different screen sizes -->
<!-- Change Font Size With Media Queries
You can also use media queries to change the font size of an element on different screen sizes. -->
