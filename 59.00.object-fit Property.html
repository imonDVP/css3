<!-- The CSS object-fit Property
The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.
This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible". -->
<!-- Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:
1.fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or
squished to fit
2.contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
3.cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
4.none - The image is not resized
5.scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain -->
<!-- Using object-fit: cover;
If we use object-fit: cover; the image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit -->
<!-- Using object-fit: contain;
If we use object-fit: contain; the image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension -->
<!-- Using object-fit: fill;
If we use object-fit: fill; the image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit -->
<!-- Using object-fit: none;

<!-- Using object-fit: scale-down;
If we use object-fit: scale-down; the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain -->
<!-- object-fit	Specifies how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container
