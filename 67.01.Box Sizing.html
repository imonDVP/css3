<!-- Without the CSS box-sizing Property
By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:
width(we set in our code) + padding + border = actual width of an element
height(we set in our code) + padding + border = actual height of an element
This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height). -->
