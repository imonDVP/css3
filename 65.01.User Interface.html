    <title>CSS Outline Offset</title>
    <!-- The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge or border of an element. -->
    <!-- Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline. -->
    <style>
        /* The following example uses the outline-offset property to add space between the border and the outline: */
        div.ex1 {
            margin: 20px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            outline: 4px solid red;
            outline-offset: 15px;
        }

        div.ex2 {
            margin: 10px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            outline: 5px dashed blue;
            outline-offset: 5px;
        }
