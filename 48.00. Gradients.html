<!--
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
CSS defines three types of gradients:
1.Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
2.Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
3.Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point) -->
<!--
CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
Syntax:
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...); -->

<!-- Direction - Top to Bottom (this is default)
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
} -->
<!-- Direction - Left to Right
#grad {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);
  } -->
<!--
  Direction - Diagonal
You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.
#grad {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow);
  } -->
<!--
Using Angles:
If you want more control over the direction of the gradient, you can define an angle, instead of the predefined directions (to bottom, to top, to right, to left, to bottom right, etc.). A value of 0deg is equivalent to "to top". A value of 90deg is equivalent to "to right". A value of 180deg is equivalent to "to bottom".
Syntax:
background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
}
-->
<!-- Using Multiple Color Stops
The following example shows a linear gradient (from top to bottom) with multiple color stops:
#grad {
    background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);
  } -->
<!-- Using Transparency
CSS gradients also support transparency, which can be used to create fading effects.
To add transparency, we use the rgba() function to define the color stops. The last parameter in the rgba() function can be a value from 0 to 1, and it defines the transparency of the color: 0 indicates full transparency, 1 indicates full color (no transparency).
#grad {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,0,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,1));
  } -->
<!-- Repeating a linear-gradient
The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients:
A repeating linear gradient:
#grad {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
} -->
