<!-- When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet. -->
<!-- There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
1.External CSS
2.Internal CSS
3.Inline CSS -->
<!-- External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page. -->
<!-- External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page -->
<!-- This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.pust.ac.com/html/styles.css"> -->
<!-- This example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site:<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css"> -->
<!-- This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> -->
<!-- Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px):
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (no space): margin-left: 20px; -->
<!-- An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section. -->
<!-- An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property. -->
<!-- Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly. -->
<!-- If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.  -->
<!-- What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
1.Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2.External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3.Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults. -->
