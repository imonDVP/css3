<!-- To horizontally center a block element (like <div>), use margin: auto;
Setting the width of the element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container.
The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins -->
<!-- Note: Center aligning has no effect if the width property is not set (or set to 100%). -->
<!-- To just center the text inside an element, use text-align: center; -->
<!-- To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element -->
<!-- One method for aligning elements is to use position: absolute; -->
<!-- Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements. -->
<!-- Another method for aligning elements is to use the float property -->
<!-- Note: If an element is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, it will overflow outside of its container. You can use the "clearfix hack" to fix this -->
<!-- Then we can add the clearfix hack to the containing element to fix this problem -->
<!-- There are many ways to center an element vertically in CSS. A simple solution is to use top and bottom padding -->
<!-- To center both vertically and horizontally, use padding and text-align: center -->
<!-- Another trick is to use the line-height property with a value that is equal to the height property -->
