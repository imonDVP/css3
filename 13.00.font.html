<!-- Choosing the right font for your website is important! -->
<!-- Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.
The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.
Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font. -->
<!-- In CSS there are five generic font families:
1.Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2.Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3.Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look.
4.Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
5.Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts. -->
<!-- In CSS, we use the font-family property to specify the font of a text.
Note: If the font name is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".
Tip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with comma. -->
